# Welcome to My Cat
A custom implementation of the `cat` command in C language,
which reads the contents of one or more files passed as command-line arguments and prints the contents to the console.

## Task
Create a program called my_cat which does the same thing as the system's cat command used in the command-line.
Your program should read the content of each files which are received as an argument to your software.
Unlike the real Cat command, you don't have to handle any options.

## Description
-Reads the contents of one or more files passed as command-line arguments.
-Prints the contents of the files to the console.
-Handles errors gracefully, and prints an error message if there is an issue reading the file.
-Doesn't handle any options, it will just read the content of the file passed as an argument and print it to the console.
-The program uses standard C library functions that are widely supported, making it portable and easy to understand.

## Installation
-Download the program's source code
-Compile the program by running gcc my_cat.c -o my_cat command
-Make the file executable by running chmod +x my_cat
-Add the executable file to a directory included in the system's PATH
-Now you can run the program by typing ./my_cat followed by the file name you want to read.
--It's important to note that you need to have a C compiler installed on your system and make
sure you have the necessary dependencies installed before installing the program.

## Usage
This program provides a simple and easy-to-use implementation of the `cat` command,
which can be useful for reading the contents of files in a script or command-line application.

```
./my_project argument1 argument2
```
